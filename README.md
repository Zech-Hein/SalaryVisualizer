## About
I had a dream for a fun visual way to watch money be earned, penny-by-penny, dollar-by-dollar!

### Attempt#1 
I started by asking Grok to "write a program to visualize money earned from a salary, penny-by-penny, dollar-by-dollar, like watching a turn-dial.
The first program it gave was in python, and was a simple CLI.

### Attempt#2
I then asked "Could you make the program able to display on a webpage instead, and add a cartoon dollar image falling for each dollar earned"
Suprisingly, it was able to do it, for the most part.
